MoodEase: Empowering Mental Wellbeing App
Project Description
           In today's fast-paced and demanding world, prioritizing mental health and emotional well-being is more important than ever. Recognizing the importance of mental health and the need for accessible and effective resources, MoodEase emerged as an innovative mobile application designed to empower individuals in improving their mental wellbeing. 
         MoodEase is a mobile application designed to provide information and support for individuals dealing with stress, depression, and related mental health issues. The app offers a range of tips and suggestions to help users manage their emotions and improve their well-being. In addition to the tips, the app also features a list of contacts that can be reached out to in case of an emergency. These emergency contacts may include helpline numbers, crisis hotlines, or trusted individuals who can provide immediate assistance and support during critical situations. The availability of this list ensures that users have access to the necessary resources and support when they need it most.
           In response, the team aims to design and develop the MoodEase mobile app, which will empower users to enhance their mental wellbeing. The tools that will be used are Ionic Framework, Typescript, and Angular which are useful for developing mobile applications. The development team will leverage modern mobile app development frameworks and languages, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
